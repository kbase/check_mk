* check_mk_awe: scripts for checking AWE status (currently in admin_tools repo)
* check_xfs: check status of XFS filesystems.  Requires you to touch testfs file on every mounted XFS filesystem.
* check_mongo: check status of mongod, including replication.  Requires separate check_mongodb.py plugin (on github, will find later)
* check_galera: check status of a Galera cluster (probably came from a github repo somewhere originally but I think there are local edits)
